I'm an aspiring machine learning engineer passionate about removing algorithmic bias in high-risk environments like crime, healthcare, and finance. I love tackling real-world problems through data analysis and predictive modeling, but I'm also big on continuously learning and building my skills through hands-on projects.

My journey bridges software engineering experience at Blackstone with data science research focused on women's retention in STEM. I've been selected for the Cornell Tech AI Fellowship and the ALPFA Fellowship, opportunities that have helped me grow both as a technical problem-solver and an inclusive leader.

**Currently:** Completing Break Through Tech AI Studio program, developing ML solutions for real-world industry challenges

## Featured Project: AI Studio Project - Coming Fall 2025
*This space reserved for my collaborative machine learning project solving real-world industry challenges with Cornell Tech mentorship.*
